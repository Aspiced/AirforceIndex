            <h2>Information</h2>
            <p class="infor1">The Lockheed Martin/Boeing F-22 Raptor is an American twin-engine all-weather stealth fighter aircraft developed and produced for the United States Air Force (USAF). As a product of the USAF's Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) program the aircraft was designed as an air superiority fighter, but also incorporates ground attack, electronic warfare, and signals intelligence capabilities. The prime contractor, Lockheed Martin, built most of the F-22's airframe and weapons systems and conducted final assembly, while program partner Boeing provided the wings, aft fuselage, avionics integration, and training systems.

                The F-22 descended from the Lockheed YF-22 and first flew in 1997, and was variously designated F-22 and F/A-22 before it formally entered service in December 2005 as the F-22A. Although the USAF had originally planned to buy a total of 750 ATFs and later scaled down to 381, the program was cut to 195 aircraft — 187 of them operational models — in 2009 due to political opposition from high costs, a lack of air-to-air missions at the time of production, and the development of the more affordable and versatile F-35. The last aircraft was delivered in 2012.
                
                After a protracted development and initial operational difficulties, the F-22 became a critical component of the USAF's tactical airpower for air-to-air missions against peer adversaries. While designed for counter-air operations, the aircraft has also performed strike and electronic support missions in the Middle East against the Islamic State and Assad-aligned forces. The F-22 will remain a cornerstone of the USAF's fighter fleet until its succession by the crewed Next Generation Air Dominance fighter.</p>
